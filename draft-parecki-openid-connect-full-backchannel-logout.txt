                OpenID Connect Full Back-Channel Logout
      draft-parecki-openid-connect-full-backchannel-logout-latest

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 [OpenID] is an identity layer on top of the OAuth
   2.0 [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of
   the End-User based on the authentication performed by an
   Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information
   about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout defines a mechanism for an OP to
   signal to an RP that a user should be logged out.  However, it
   recommends that refresh tokens issued with the offline_access scope
   SHOULD NOT be revoked.

   This specification defines a new back-channel logout request that
   adds the requirement to revoke all refresh tokens, in addition to
   terminating the session.
